# Plot Potential

Created: 4 May 2021

Plot individual potential functions that comprise force fields. **Ideal for presentations.** 

Includes energy terms for:
* bonds (harmonic),
* angles (harmonic),
* proper torsion (periodic cosine),
* improper torsion (harmonic),
* van der Waals (Lennard-Jones),
* electrostatics (Coulomb), and
* the Morse potential.

The plotting code is all in **`plot_potential.py`**.
